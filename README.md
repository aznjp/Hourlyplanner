# Hourlyplanner

The quizgame application is created using 

* Utilization of third party API's such as Bootstrap and Jquery to have
consistent coding structure and simpler formatting 
* Localstorage functions to hold scores (This time using objects as opposed to 
arrays due to multiple properties to one object)
* Ability to use moment.js within code to validate, parse, manipulate and display dates (Used to not only show date at the top of the html, but also to compare property id's with individual time blocks to activate certain functions and fill back in textarea)
